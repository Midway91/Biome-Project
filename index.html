        <h1>Rainforest</h1>
        <p>The rainforest has tall trees and extreme ammounts of rainfall. The rainforest receives the largest ammount of rain among all the other biomes because it rains all year round.
           There are two sub-biomes, tropical rainforests and temperate rainforests. There are four layers of a rainforest. They are the Emergent layer, Canopy layer, Understory, and the Rainforest floor. 
           Rainforests are a result of the rain shadow effect which is put in more detail on a different page. The average temperature and rainfall in a temperate rainforest are at least 55in (140cm) of rainfall and temps. of 39-54&deg;f (4-12&deg;c).
           The average temperature and rainfall for a tropical rainforest are usually 79-394in (200-1000cm) of rain and temps. of 68-84&deg;f (20-29&deg;c).
