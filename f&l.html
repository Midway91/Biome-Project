        <h1>Flora</h1>

        <h3>Corpse Flower</h3>
        <p>These flowers, like its name implies, smells and feels like a rotting corpse. This attracts flies and other insects that lay eggs on decaying flesh. When these insects go to lay their eggs, the flowers
            puts its pollen on them to pollinate.
        </p>

        <h3>Buttress Roots</h3>
        <p>Trees have developed buttress roots because there isn't much nutrients in the ground in a rainforest. The highest levels of nutrients are in the top soil and so the roots don't grow deep because there is no benefit 
            in doing so. They only go into the top soil and other trees' buttress roots grow through other buttress roots, creating a mesh, which holds the trees up.
        </p>

        <h3>Large Leaves</h3>
        <p>Plants in the lower levels of the rainforest have developed large leaves so that they can absorb more sunlight for photosynthesis.</p>

        <h3>Thin/smooth bark</h3>
        <p>Trees have developed thin and smooth bark because they don't need to try to keep in moisture because it rains so much.</p>

        <h3>Drip Tips</h3>
        <p>Leaves in the rainforest have developed a waxy layer and some pointed tips to let the excess water run off so that algae doesn't grow on them and block the sunlight.</p>


        <h1>Fauna</h1>

        <h3>Sloth</h3>
        <p>The sloth has adapted to the rainforest by becoming nocturnal. This helps them avoid predators that aren't nocturnal. Sloths move very slow which helps them conserve energy and it makes them hard to spot.
            Their arms are longer than their legs and their feet are curved which makes it easier to grab and move through the trees. Sloths also have 3 extra neck bones. This means that they can move their head 270&deg;. 
            This makes it easier to spot predators and eat leaves.
        </p>

        <h3>Spider Monkeys</h3>
        <p>Spider Monkeys' tail has adapted to become prehensile. They can use it to hang upside down, swing, and they can even throw stuff with it.</p>

        <h3>Jaguars</h3>
        <p>Jaguars for one, don't mind the water. In fact they actually swim and bathe in it. They also developed large claws, which allow them to climb up the smooth trees.</p>

        <h3>Poison Dart Frog</h3>
        <p>The Poison Dart Frog developed a bright color skin to warn its predators not to eat it because it is poisonous. They have adapted to become poisonous to deter predators from eating them.
            Not all Dart Frogs are poisonous, but they still have the bright colors to bluff their way out of any tough situations.
        </p>

        <h3>Toucan</h3>
        <p>Toucans have adapted to only eat fruit that other animals (including other birds) can't eat.</p>

        <h3>Katydid</h3>
        <p>Katydids have adapted to look and behave like a wasp although it is related to the Grasshopper. This helps deter predators from trying to eat it.</p>
