        <h3>Sloth</h3>
        <p>The sloth has adapted to the rainforest by becoming nocturnal. This helps them avoid predators that aren't nocturnal. Sloths move very slow which helps them conserve energy and it makes them hard to spot.
            Their arms are longer than their legs and their feet are curved which makes it easier to grab and move through the trees. Sloths also have 3 extra neck bones. This means that they can move their head 270&deg;. 
            This makes it easier to spot predators and eat leaves.
